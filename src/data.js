        `The Versa Connect takes these attributes and focuses on extending

        It is our aim to product a conversion that is both practical and stylish, 
        with an attention to detail that provides the same high quality look and 
        feel throughout the vehicle.`,
        `The Versa Connect is available in two wheelbases. The Short Versa Connect 
        can accommodate the wheelchair user and up to 3 seated passengers 
        (including the driver) or up to 5 seated passengers without the wheelchair. 
        The Long Versa Connect can accommodate the wheelchair user up to 5 seats 
        passengers (including the driver) or up to 7 seated passengers without the 
        wheelchair.`,
        `Twin sliding doors allow for ease of passenger access with a lightweight 
        manual ramp to the rear for the wheelchair access. As an optional extra, 
        the ramp can have the added ability, using a simple level, to fold- at into
         the vehicle so that when the wheelchair user is not travelling, a huge and
        easily accessible boot space is created making the Versa Connect even more practical.`
